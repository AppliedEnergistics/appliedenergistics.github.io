They will still slowly  slow down to check every three seconds if they have nothing to do.\n* The charger now allows cable connections from all sides except the front, instead of only the top or bottom. Thanks @62832, @Sea-Kerman!\n* Remove artificial limit to ~2 billion per extract operation from storage cells (effectively limited fluid cells to 26,512 buckets/op on Fabric).

The API for addon developers should already be stable, with a few maintenance changes from the 1.18.2 API.**_\n\nPlease note that certus quartz was reworked heavily, and the wiki might not be up-to-date yet. Here is a summary of the changes:\n\n## Removed certus/fluix seeds and certus quartz ore\nSelf-explanatory. See below for the replacements.\n\n## Budding certus quartz\nBudding certus quartz is a new block that will grow certus quartz crystals, similar to how budding amethyst grows amethyst shards. It exists in the following variants:\n- Flawless: will never deplete. Breaking with silk touch gives Flawed, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\n- Flawed: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to Chipped after growing a crystal. Breaking with silk touch gives Chipped, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\n- Chipped: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to Damaged after growing a crystal. Breaking with silk touch gives Damaged, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\n- Damaged: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to regular Certus Quartz Block. Breaking always gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\n\n**Flawless is a lot easier to automate because it doesn't need replacement (see below), however it can only be moved by using Spatial IO or other modded block moving techniques (e.g. Create contraptions).**\n\nLeft to right: Flawless, Flawed, Chipped, Damaged, regular block.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499713-f33cc697-dff1-4603-be6f-73009fdacbf6.png)\n\n## Certus quartz buds\nThey exist in 3 growth stages. Breaking them with silk touch gives the bud itself, breaking without silk touch gives certus quartz dust.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499735-4ee2ee1a-3894-4dd8-97e8-44e175762dc3.png)\n\n## Certus quartz clusters\nThe 4th and final growth stage. Breaking them with silk touch gives the cluster itself, breaking without silk touch gives 4 certus quartz crystals, increased by fortune.\n\n## Recharging budding certus quartz\nA \"depleted\" certus quartz block can be recharged using charged certus quartz:\n- Certus Quartz Block + Charged Certus Quartz -> Damaged Budding Certus Quartz,\n- Damaged Budding Certus Quartz + Charged Certus Quartz -> Chipped Budding Certus Quartz,\n- Chipped Quartz Block + Charged Certus Quartz -> Flawed Budding Certus Quartz,\n- (Flawless Budding Certus Quartz is not craftable, it can only be found in meteorites).\n\nIn order:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499853-eeed6053-1cc7-4444-9ec0-9cc291a7d582.png)\n\n## Meteorite changes\nMeteorites now contain a small room around the chest containing a few Certus Quartz Blocks (either the regular one, or one of the 4 budding variants, picked randomly), and a few buds. Fluix blocks have been removed.\n\nSince obtaining certus quartz requires finding a meteorite, the meteorite compass is now crafted by charging a regular compass in the Charger.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499861-bf86ebf9-6027-4798-b629-b6ffc69f4748.png)\n\n## Crystal growth accelerators\nCGAs will now increase the random tick rate of adjacent blocks tagged with `#ae2:growth_acceleratable`. By default this only includes budding amethyst and the 4 budding certus quartz, but packmakers can configure this tag to support any tag. The acceleration rate is configurable.\n\nExample automation setup with 4 budding blocks (requires additional autocrafting to turn the depleted blocks back into their flawless variant):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499911-a75219eb-c7e2-4aa3-a4ec-1a8064ba5231.png)\n\n## Turning certus and fluix dust back into crystals\nThis is now possible using charged certus quartz in water:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499871-d90e2a67-1d18-4b2b-b1d2-b48bf1552570.png)\n\nIn-world crafting for fluix now gives fluix crystals (as was the case in 1.16-).",

    "changelog": "## Highlights\n### [Forge only] Changes to the config system\nThe AE2 config was moved to the `appliedenergistics2/client.json` and `appliedenergistics/common.json` files, and it is now using a custom system instead of the usual Forge `.toml` config system. This should be just as easy to configure as before, however please make sure to migrate your config files from the old format to this new format. This was done to fix various issues caused by Forge loading configs too late for our needs, and explicitly refusing to load them earlier when asked about it.\n### Fortune annihilation plane\nThe annihilation plane is now enchantable with mining tool enchantments, and will keep its enchants when placed. In particular, this includes Fortune and Silk Touch enchantments. The old Identity Annihilation Plane is deprecated, but it will still work in 1.18, and it will only be removed in 1.19.\n* Fix #6194 by making the ME Annihilation Plane enchantable by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6203\n### Keybinds to open Wireless Terminals and Portable Cells\n* Add keybinds for Wireless (Crafting) Terminal and Portable Storage Cells by @Mari023 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6251\n### Performance\n**This release vastly improves autocrafting performance**. Previously, autocrafting would simulate extraction of the entire contents of the network every time it started a crafting calculation. Now, it uses the cached item list. **In particular, if you set a storage bus to show non-extractable items, this might lead to incorrect results. The old behavior of simulating a full network extraction can be enabled in the config, but doing so is not recommended for performance reasons, and that option will probably be removed eventually.\n* Fix #6307: Make crafting calculations use the cached inventory by default by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6310.\n\n## API\n* Expose IAutoCraftingMenu in API, use player's menu in crafting terminal by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6278\n* Refactor CraftingUnitType for easier add-on extensibility by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6277\n\n## Bug fixes and small changes\n* Fix #6281: Add void and equal distribution upgrade to fluid cells by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6282\n* Add back option to display Facades in REI by @Mari023 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6317\n* Add an REI category of P2P tunnel attunement items by @ramidzkh in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6302\n* Fix accelerated Export Bus Dupe Issues when Network shows items twice by @shartte in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6296\n* Fix #6289: Add powered/unpowered states to ME IO and Spatial IO ports by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6290\n* Fix #6293: Properly render AppMek patterns by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6308\n* Fix #6291: Energy cells' status bars fill when the cell itself is only half-full by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6309\n* Fix #6303: increase ME chest power buffer from 40 to 500 by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6324\n* Fix #6275: fix wrong requested number in crafting status by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6327\n* Fix #6299: add more stuff to common `dusts`/`gems` tags by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6328\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/compare/forge/v11.0.0...forge/v11.1.0",

    "changelog": "## What's Changed\n* Internal overhaul of recipe transfer. It should now work for all relevant recipe types and correctly import amounts for items/fluids. It also uses better prioritization when encoding items into patterns.\n  * *NOTE: Recipe transfer refers to pressing the \"+\" button in a JEI or REI recipe while an AE screen is open*\n  * Recipe transfer will now use Vanilla ingredient rules when being used in a crafting terminal (this should now work a lot better with damaged items or items with NBT)\n  * The pattern encoder will now switch modes automatically based on the recipe being transfered (crafting table recipes -> crafting mode, everything else -> processing mode)\n  * For processing patterns, recipe transfer will now group together multiple copies of the same ingredient and sum their amounts\n* When a processing pattern has multiple outputs there is no a button to cycle the primary output between the encoded outputs to better support transfering processing recipes from JEI, where it is unknown which output is the primary.\n\n## Fixes\n* Fix middle mouse button not opening the \"set amount\" screen in the pattern encoder in survival mode (#5968)\n* Fix unpowered drives/chests not showing the black cell LEDs (#5949)\n* Fix network tool not saving its contents when existing items were being split/stacked in the UI (#5955)\n* Fix that storage bus/formation plane would not show the contents of the config slots below the second row when being opened for the first time after being loaded (#5969)",

It also uses better prioritization when encoding items into patterns.\n  * *NOTE: Recipe transfer refers to pressing the \"+\" button in a JEI or REI recipe while an AE screen is open*\n  * Recipe transfer will now use Vanilla ingredient rules when being used in a crafting terminal (this should now work a lot better with damaged items or items with NBT)\n  * The pattern encoder will now switch modes automatically based on the recipe being transfered (crafting table recipes -> crafting mode, everything else -> processing mode)\n  * For processing patterns, recipe transfer will now group together multiple copies of the same ingredient and sum their amounts\n\n## Fixes\n* Fix middle mouse button not opening the \"set amount\" screen in the pattern encoder in survival mode (#5968)\n* Fix unpowered drives/chests not showing the black cell LEDs (#5949)\n* Fix network tool not saving its contents when existing items were being split/stacked in the UI (#5955)\n* Fix that storage bus/formation plane would not show the contents of the config slots below the second row when being opened for the first time after being loaded (#5969)",

(#5894)\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147517845-9485d5a9-fdf2-4f97-8583-14cac6139fca.png)\n* Indicate when items are being hidden through JEI or REI search (#5904)\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147518211-63b5bc73-3c4f-4895-b4e0-a4eb15e1e1a4.png)\n* [Fabric, REI only] Improved REI One-Click Recipe Transfer for encoding processing patterns by adding support for multiple outputs, fluid inputs, and using the exact fluid amount from the recipe automatically. (JEI has no API for this yet) (#5871)\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147518472-5d945326-e2f3-4f8f-8aed-2570de8fd445.png)\n* Update fluid portable cell textures to match the fluid storage cells (#5887)\n* Slightly change crafting recipes for portable cells to ensure players don't accidentally void storage cells by using them to craft portable cells. (#5892)\n* Add tooltips to the inscriber slot to describe on which sides they can be automated. (#5881) \n* [API] We now publish an API primer and Javadoc on our website: https://appliedenergistics.github.io/api.html\n* [Internal] Integrated with Crowdin to enable crowdsourced translations for AE2. Please ask on Discord for details on how to contribute. (#5878)\n\n## Bugfixes and other Changes\n\n* Fixes excessive energy drain for Fluid P2P tunnel. Thanks @DrummerMC! (Fixes #5876)\n* Fix Pattern-Provider Blocking Mode when a Crafting CPU with multiple Co-Processors inserted multiple items on the same tick into a storage bus. Every insertion will now be taken into account by the next when testing \"does this already contain the ingredients?\". (#5870)\n* Fixes that power consumption for Fluid autocrafting was calculated incorrectly and was far too high. Thanks @DrummerMC! (#5872)\n* Fix cables and parts dropping while breaking them in creative mode. They should only drop contained items now. (#5838)\n* Fix Tiny TNT destroying waterlogged blocks. Thanks @Azercoco! (#5895)\n* Use appropriate 3D models when portable cells are inserted into an ME drive (#5900)\n* Fix ME Chest not showing changing cell state (full, empty, etc.) immediately. (#5903)\n* Fix client-side ghost parts when security-checks fail for placed parts (#5905)\n* Disable rotation feature for network tool allowing it to show the network status on rotatable blocks (#5907)\n* Update search in Terminal if the search mode is toggled away from REI/JEI search (#5906)\n* Fix sorting for fluids in terminal sorting by millibucket/droplet instead of bucket amount. Thanks @DrummerMC! (#5910)\n",

    "changelog": "**WARNING**\n\nItems will not migrate over from 1.17 or before due to the mod-id changing to ae2 in this release, and fully unifying fluid/item machines.\n\nMore in-depth release notes will follow in a later release (probably in the beta).\n\n## Channel Modes\n\nThis alpha version introduces new options to change how AE2 channels behave in your world. There's a new configuration option in the general section (channels) which controls this option, and a new in-game comman for operators to change the mode and the config from inside the game. The command is `/ae2 channelmode <mode>` to change it and `/ae2 channelmode` to show the current mode. When the mode is changed in-game, all existing grids will reboot and use the new mode immediately.\n\nAvailable modes:\n\n- `default` The standard mode with the known channel capacities of cable and ad-hoc networks\n- `x2` All channel capacities are doubled (16 on normal cable, 64 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 16 channels)\n- `x3` All channel capacities are tripled (24 on normal cable, 92 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 24 channels)\n- `x4` All channel capacities are quadrupled (32 on normal cable, 128 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 32 channels)\n- `infinite` All channel restrictions are removed. Controllers still reduce the power consumption of grids *significantly*. Smart cables will only toggle between completely off (no channels carried) and completely on (1 or more channels carried).\n\nThis resurrects and improves upon the option that was available before 1.15 and introduces better options for players that just want a little more laid back gameplay but don't want the mechanic to be removed entirely.\n\nSince this option is brand new, we'd appreciate intense testing of it. Please report and issues you might find on our GitHub / Discord.\n\n## Fixes\n\n- [Forge] Fix recipe for copying silicon plates (#5796)\n- Fix pattern provider not displaying where it is pointing if it is made directional with a wrench\n- Fix disassembly of fluid cells returning an item instead of a fluid cell housing (#5808, thanks ramidzkh!)\n- Fixes various ticking issues with AE2 machines, primarily machines waking up potentially preventing other machines from ticking for some time. (Use a debug card in your off-hand to see the ticking behavior of AE2 machines in WTHIT/Jade)\n- Fix Import-/Export-Bus Redstone Pulse Behavior. Upon receiving a redstone pulse, the bus will now wake itself up and perform the operation on the next tick. It now correctly remembers that a pulse occured even if it doesn't get a chance to tick before the chunk/world is unloaded. Fixes that buses would mis-interpret a high redstone signal at world load as a pulse\n- Fixes the charger always using its minimum tick rate and ignoring the maximum\n- Fixes crafting simulation if multiple options to craft the same item exist\n- Fixes the matter cannon crashing if it had no ammo when fired (#5806)\n- Fixes the matter cannon crashing if fired from a dispenser (#5814)\n- Fixes storage and conversion monitors not showing the stored amount and not abbreviating large amounts (#5819)\n- Fixes interfaces not moving out items from their storage into the network while waiting for items to craft while using a crafting card upgrade, essentially preventing the crafted items from being inserted (#5803)\n- Fixes tooltips saying \"JEI\" instead of \"REI\" on Fabric, and renamed \"FE P2P Tunnel\" to \"Energy P2P Tunnel\" (#5677)\n- Fixes cables attempting to connect through cable anchors/parts to adjacent blocks if the cable anchor/part was placed before the cable (prevent needless network reboot) (#5820)\n- Fixes AE2 blocks retaining their configuration when being broken/disassembled, making them unstackable. A memory card must be used instead to copy the config if needed (#5818)\n- Fixes a rare problem where opening an AE2 screen would leave a zombie screen open if the block was already removed on the client before the screen actually got a chance to open. This fixes a crash when certain other mods were used (seamless_loading_screen). AE2 will now log a message sooner and close the screen server-side. (#5642)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Introduced more information to WTHIT/Jade when looking at smart cables. For Ad-Hoc Networks, two error states will be shown (Too Many Channels, Nested P2P Tunnel) to explain why an Ad-Hoc network has gone offline. For networks with controllers, it now shows if there are two conflicting controllers on the grid.\n- Minimum boot times of networks have been reduced from 20 to 5 ticks. The increase in boot time for additional nodes is still the same.\n- During a network boot, 4 steps are now taken per tick instead of 1. This is configurable now in a new config option `pathfindingStepsPerTick` in case you experience severe server-side tick latency when networks reboot\n- \"Partial Plan (Missing Ingredients)\" is now shown instead of \"Simulation\" when auto-crafting cannot be started due to missing items\n- Use correct tag for wrenches so wrenches from other mods should now be usable\n- Remove spam about data fixers not being registered for AE2 entities (they still aren't, but no more log spam)\n- Use the default locale to format storage amounts (mostly affects the decimal point)\n\n## API\n\n- [Breaking, API]: Removed InteractionHand from `IPart#onPlacement` and `IPartHost#addPart`\n- [API] TickingRequest now allows the initial tick rate to be specified separately (default is still (min+max)/2)\n- [Breaking, API]: Removed the directionality of `IPartHost#hasRedstone` since it wasn't directional internally and just returns if the block the cable is in is receiving a redstone signal.\n- [Breaking, API]: Some changes to `IAEStackRenderHandler`, `AEKeyType` (for custom addon storage types) related to formatting amounts. Formatting is now automatically provided based on the amount per unit (i.e. 1000 for Fluids) and the unit symbol (i.e. 'B' for fluids).\n- [Internal] Allow SlotSemantic to be used by addons that target AE2's internal classes\n- [API] Add `#getMaxChannels` and `#getUsedChannels` to IGridNode\n- [API] Add `#getChannelMode` to `IPathingService` to retrieve the current channel mode used for a grid\n- [API] `PartHelper` now has a `getPart` method to more easily get the part attached at a certain position in the world\n- [Breaking, API] Various changes around `IPart` now being based only around an `IPartItem` instance, no longer around `ItemStack`",

They now allow entering the fluid amount in buckets with support for decimals (i.e. 0.25 B). (#5712)\n* Allow the mouse-wheel to be used to increment/decrement the amount in amount entry dialogs (level emitters, crafting amount, etc.)\n* Fix level emitters with crafting card upgrades not correctly updating when crafting started/stopped\n* Fix craftable patterns being added/removed not being reflected in ME terminals while they were open (#5779)\n* Fix crash issues when storage was detached/attached from the network while items were being inserted or extracted from it (i.e. storage bus on drive or insertion on same tick as network reboot) (#5744)\n* We now also publish on Modrinth in addition to CurseForge, Github and ModMaven (#5689)\n* Crafting monitor can now correctly display fluids and their amount when a fluid recipe is being auto-crafted (#5792)\n* Fixed WTHIT/Jade tooltip not correctly showing name of the displayed item or fluid when hovering over crafting and storage monitors (#5791)\n* Fixed patterns not being correctly removed from being craftable when they were taken out of a pattern provider\n* Fix network reboots not notifying nodes properly leading to delayed visual updates when a network reboot was triggered by placing or removing cables/parts\n* API/Internal: Removed monitorable storage (IMEMonitor), network storage change detection is now done at most once per tick (#5789)\n* Internal/Performance: Fix unnecessary network storage rebuilds occurring for drives when their storage cells didn't actually change\n* Internal/Performance: Improve how network connections are made/split when nodes are added or destroyed (#5780)\n",

This can be used to easily extend it to cover machines of other mods.\n\nFor server owners not wanting this functionality it is recommended to simply disable the recipe. Otherwise there is currently nothing planed besides what forge itself offers at a global level to limit them.\n\n##  Feature #4972: Cables and a few other blocks can now be placed under water\n\nThis includes all cables, both skystone chests, charged quartz fixture, and light detecting fixture\n\n**Important** This required a semantic change `IFacadePart#getBoxes(IPartCollisionHelper ch, boolean itemEntity);`. The `boolean` now indicates when an `ItemEntity` collides with a facade an no longer a `LivingEntity`.\nHowever there should be no other mods affected by it currently.\n\n\nPlease use 3rd party documentation about valid options for each block or fluid. \nWe avoid setting invalid combinations, but in some cases it might work unexpected. E.g. the direction might be flipped when converting between different block types.\n\nFor further examples take a look at the [provided recipes](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/tree/master/src/main/resources/data/appliedenergistics2/recipes/entropy) by us.\n\n## Feature #5135: Added recipes for the new and larger portable cells.\n\nThe recipe for them were not added previously as their properties were not fully set in stone.\nTo avoid potential issues, no recipes did exists in case these would change again.\n\n## Various changes and bugfixes\n\n**Feature #4136: Allow inverter cards to be used for fluid cells**\nInverter cards can now be used for all fluid cells similar to item cells. E.g. to allow anything but water.\n\n**Feature #4625: Consider using `PreventRemoteMovement` for seeds**\nThis will prevent seeds from being picked up by magnets supporting this tag while growing. Once they are fully grown the tag is removed and magnets are free to pick them up again.\n\n**Fixes #4753: Internal consistency fix for \"hand swinging\" animation when using items**\nThis should prevent the tool from being swung twice from various causes like a higher latency.\n\n**Fixes #4754: Allow reporting parts (terminals, monitors, etc.) to be rotated again**\nUseful to rotate terminals placed in a floor or ceiling to match a prefered direction.\nVertically placed ones will always be placed with the top facing up, for horizontally ones it will take the direction a player takes into account and place the top side facing away from the player.\n\n**Fixes #4996: Forge 1.16.5-36.0.34 broke all rotatable models using multipart models**\nForge did a breaking change with this release prevent some of our blocks to be rotated visually. The change will be at least backwards compatible with our minimum requirement.\n\n**Fixes #5004: Prevent `AEBaseTileEntity#saveChanges()` leaking client TEs**\nThis will prevent clientside tile entites from being ticked on the server\n\n**Fixes #5017: Skip border chunks until ready.**\nDue chunks are now loaded in minecraft, it can happen that chunks at the border of the loaded area are stuck in a limbo. \nHence our tile entities had a change to never be initialized.\n\n**Fixes #5021: Disable EU conversion until IC2 is ported.**\nAs IC2 (or any alternative generating EU) does not exists for 1.16 for now, we disabled the option to calculate the energy consumption in EU.\nOnce this changes, it will be added back.\n\n**Fixes #5040: Fixes to chest closing sound timings. (Thanks @markfowden)**\nThis is now consistent with the behaviour of a vanilla chest.\n\n**Fixes #5053: Notify TileEntity after being moved to update their state**\nSome blocks like chests would not be correctly updated after being moved with a spatial transport, this should now be taken care of.\n\n**Fixes #5055: Temporary load an area after a spatial transport to allow transporting a spatial anchor+quantum bridge into a spatial cell and having it work.**\nAdds a small grace period after a spatial anchor is transfered in or out of a spatial dimension to ensure it can still load the network.\n**Note**: It will not cover exceptionally large cells, these might still need a player visit to be fullied loaded once.\n\n**Fixes #5061: Use \"sneaking\" (shift-key held) instead of \"crouch pose\" to determine alternate-use mode for AE2 items.**\nPreviously it would prevent holding shift + space during flying from being able to wrench parts. Also it could cause the wrench to act as shift clicking when the player is forced into a crouch pose, e.g. through entering a space slightly smaller than 2 blocks in height.\n\n**Fixes #5069: Fix crash on chunk unload in worlds without any AE2 tiles**\nThe setup needed for each world would not run correctly without any AE2 tile being placed already.\n\n**Fixes #5083: Send forge capabilities to the client-side for items using them to be picked back up from ME Terminals.**\nThis should now allow to pick up any item from a terminal and not prevent in some very rare cases.\n**Note**: This can result very minor increase the network traffic when taking something from a terminal, with a few exception when some items store massive amounts of data. This is sadly a limitation in forge and their item capability implementation making it very hard to map a client side itemstack to a serverside one.\n\n**Fixes #5096: Fix CME during tile init when multiblocks load adjacent chunks.**\nSome AE2 multiblocks need to be loaded completely for now. Which cannot be fully resolved without an API break and therefore is pushed back to 9.0 or later.\n\n**Change #5099: Use fastutil for the internal ItemList data**\nThis should provide a small performance increase under extremely heavy loads.\nPretty much will have no noticable effect for a player, but makes testing some massive edge cases more managable.\n\n**Fixes #5109: Don't mutate the item list while iterating over it.**\nWould otherwise result in a crash sometimes.\n\n**Fixes #5120: Always remove a cable bus once empty.**\nUnder very rare conditions a cable tile entity could be left empty instead of being fully removed and prevent players from placing any other block there besides another AE2 cable or part.\n\n**Fixes #5132: Rare crash in crafting status screen when data for CPU arrived late on the client**\nA high latency could cause the name of a crafting cpu to not be present yet and crash.\n\n**Fixes #5137: Quartz ore and skystone did not require a tool**\nThese blocks could be incorrectly broken by hand and still drop the matching blocks or items. Albeitly very slowly.\n\n**Fixes #5147: Improved compatibility with mods that would chunk-load during the world-load event (i.e. fluxnetworks)**\n\n**Fixes #5158: When a pattern provides more than requested, the cpu could still wait on more while completing a job**\nThis now resets the list of items the cpu is currently to correctly ignore any overflow.\n\n**Fixes #5172: Crash when an unbreakable stack of a damageable item entered certain parts of the network**\n\n",

Otherwise there is currently nothing planed besides what forge itself offers at a global level to limit them.\n\n##  Feature #4972: Cables and a few other blocks can now be placed under water\n\nThis includes all cables, both skystone chests, charged quartz fixture, and light detecting fixture\n\n**Important** This required a semantic change `IFacadePart#getBoxes(IPartCollisionHelper ch, boolean itemEntity);`. The `boolean` now indicates when an `ItemEntity` collides with a facade an no longer a `LivingEntity`.\nHowever there should be no other mods affected by it currently.\n\n## Other changes and bugfixes\n\n**Feature #4625: Consider using `PreventRemoteMovement` for seeds**\nThis will prevent seeds from being picked up by magnets supporting this tag while growing. Once they are fully grown the tag is removed and magnets are free to pick them up again.\n\n**Fixes #4996: Forge 1.16.5-36.0.34 broke all rotatable models using multipart models**\nForge did a breaking change with this release prevent some of our blocks to be rotated visually. The change will be at least backwards compatible with our minimum requirement.\n",

(#4742)\n  - Enter key confirms the \"Confirm Crafting\" dialog again\n  - Right Mouse Button correctly cycles backwards through CPUs, while left mouse button forward\n  - Fixes an internal problem with syncing CPU names\n  - Naming of unnamed CPUs begins at #1 now\n- #4737: Improvements to the usability of the number entry widgets (Priority, Level Emitter, Craft Amount)\n  - Fixed tab order\n  - Introduced focus state for corner buttons\n  - Allowed the player to enter any text, but add validation that only persist it if it is a valid number\n  - Enter will now confirm these dialogs and return to the previous dialog\n  - The text field is automatically focused and its contents are selected\n- #4697: Show number of required items in condenser tooltips.\n- #4733: Fix a crash bug when an external machine tries draining fluids from a fluid interface without a filter\n- #4731: Take the position where the user clicked the handle into account when calculating the new scrollbar position\n  - The scrollbar did not subtract the handle height when determining the available space for moving the handle, thus introducing drift the further down a user scrolled.\n  - The scrollbar did not resize it's trackbar when the ME inventory screens were resized and the number of rows changed, same for craft confirm.\n- #4730: While dragging the scrollbar with the mouse, it will now scroll when the mouse is not on the scrollbar anymore, and also introduces repeat-pageup/pagedown when holding the mouse on the area above or below the scrollbar handle.\n- #4728: Mark all offloading threads as daemons, which should fix the server not shutting down properly in some cases.",

This fixes damageable items merging when they shouldn't. (#4675)\n- Fixes removal of facades not invalidating the cached server-side collision boxes. (#4663)\n- Serialize the complete NBT data to avoid mismatches (#4665), solving problems where items could no longer be picked up from ME Terminals since the client's item was different from the server's item.\n- Do not double-compress packets that update ME terminals (and similar UIs) since Minecraft already compresses packets\n- Remove the use of SlotItemHandler since we are only faking an inventory-backed slot, (#4654), fixing crash bugs with certain inventory mods.\n- Fix tiles that have a \"powered\" block state from not being able to be broken when they are connected to a powered grid.\n",
