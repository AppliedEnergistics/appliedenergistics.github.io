They will still slowly  slow down to check every three seconds if they have nothing to do.\r\n* The charger now allows cable connections from all sides except the front, instead of only the top or bottom. Thanks @62832, @Sea-Kerman!\r\n* Remove artificial limit to ~2 billion per extract operation from storage cells (effectively limited fluid cells to 26,512 buckets/op on Fabric). Thanks @9p4!\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/compare/forge/v11.6.6...forge/v11.6.7",

They will still slowly  slow down to check every three seconds if they have nothing to do.\r\n* The charger now allows cable connections from all sides except the front, instead of only the top or bottom. Thanks @62832, @Sea-Kerman!\r\n* Remove artificial limit to ~2 billion per extract operation from storage cells (effectively limited fluid cells to 26,512 buckets/op on Fabric). Thanks @9p4!\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/compare/fabric/v11.6.6...fabric/v11.6.7",

The API for addon developers should already be stable, with a few maintenance changes from the 1.18.2 API.**_\r\n\r\nPlease note that certus quartz was reworked heavily, and the wiki might not be up-to-date yet. Here is a summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n## Removed certus/fluix seeds and certus quartz ore\r\nSelf-explanatory. See below for the replacements.\r\n\r\n## Budding certus quartz\r\nBudding certus quartz is a new block that will grow certus quartz crystals, similar to how budding amethyst grows amethyst shards. It exists in the following variants:\r\n- Flawless: will never deplete. Breaking with silk touch gives Flawed, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\r\n- Flawed: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to Chipped after growing a crystal. Breaking with silk touch gives Chipped, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\r\n- Chipped: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to Damaged after growing a crystal. Breaking with silk touch gives Damaged, breaking without silk touch gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\r\n- Damaged: has a 1/12 chance to deplete to regular Certus Quartz Block. Breaking always gives a regular Certus Quartz Block.\r\n\r\n**Flawless is a lot easier to automate because it doesn't need replacement (see below), however it can only be moved by using Spatial IO or other modded block moving techniques (e.g. Create contraptions).**\r\n\r\nLeft to right: Flawless, Flawed, Chipped, Damaged, regular block.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499713-f33cc697-dff1-4603-be6f-73009fdacbf6.png)\r\n\r\n## Certus quartz buds\r\nThey exist in 3 growth stages. Breaking them with silk touch gives the bud itself, breaking without silk touch gives certus quartz dust.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499735-4ee2ee1a-3894-4dd8-97e8-44e175762dc3.png)\r\n\r\n## Certus quartz clusters\r\nThe 4th and final growth stage. Breaking them with silk touch gives the cluster itself, breaking without silk touch gives 4 certus quartz crystals, increased by fortune.\r\n\r\n## Recharging budding certus quartz\r\nA \"depleted\" certus quartz block can be recharged using charged certus quartz:\r\n- Certus Quartz Block + Charged Certus Quartz -> Damaged Budding Certus Quartz,\r\n- Damaged Budding Certus Quartz + Charged Certus Quartz -> Chipped Budding Certus Quartz,\r\n- Chipped Quartz Block + Charged Certus Quartz -> Flawed Budding Certus Quartz,\r\n- (Flawless Budding Certus Quartz is not craftable, it can only be found in meteorites).\r\n\r\nIn order:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499853-eeed6053-1cc7-4444-9ec0-9cc291a7d582.png)\r\n\r\n## Meteorite changes\r\nMeteorites now contain a small room around the chest containing a few Certus Quartz Blocks (either the regular one, or one of the 4 budding variants, picked randomly), and a few buds. Fluix blocks have been removed.\r\n\r\nSince obtaining certus quartz requires finding a meteorite, the meteorite compass is now crafted by charging a regular compass in the Charger.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499861-bf86ebf9-6027-4798-b629-b6ffc69f4748.png)\r\n\r\n## Crystal growth accelerators\r\nCGAs will now increase the random tick rate of adjacent blocks tagged with `#ae2:growth_acceleratable`. By default this only includes budding amethyst and the 4 budding certus quartz, but packmakers can configure this tag to support any tag. The acceleration rate is configurable.\r\n\r\nExample automation setup with 4 budding blocks (requires additional autocrafting to turn the depleted blocks back into their flawless variant):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499911-a75219eb-c7e2-4aa3-a4ec-1a8064ba5231.png)\r\n\r\n## Turning certus and fluix dust back into crystals\r\nThis is now possible using charged certus quartz in water:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13494793/174499871-d90e2a67-1d18-4b2b-b1d2-b48bf1552570.png)\r\n\r\nIn-world crafting for fluix now gives fluix crystals (as was the case in 1.16-).",

    "changelog": "## Highlights\r\n### [Forge only] Changes to the config system\r\nThe AE2 config was moved to the `appliedenergistics2/client.json` and `appliedenergistics/common.json` files, and it is now using a custom system instead of the usual Forge `.toml` config system. This should be just as easy to configure as before, however please make sure to migrate your config files from the old format to this new format. This was done to fix various issues caused by Forge loading configs too late for our needs, and explicitly refusing to load them earlier when asked about it.\r\n### Fortune annihilation plane\r\nThe annihilation plane is now enchantable with mining tool enchantments, and will keep its enchants when placed. In particular, this includes Fortune and Silk Touch enchantments. The old Identity Annihilation Plane is deprecated, but it will still work in 1.18, and it will only be removed in 1.19.\r\n* Fix #6194 by making the ME Annihilation Plane enchantable by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6203\r\n### Keybinds to open Wireless Terminals and Portable Cells\r\n* Add keybinds for Wireless (Crafting) Terminal and Portable Storage Cells by @Mari023 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6251\r\n### Performance\r\n**This release vastly improves autocrafting performance**. Previously, autocrafting would simulate extraction of the entire contents of the network every time it started a crafting calculation. Now, it uses the cached item list. **In particular, if you set a storage bus to show non-extractable items, this might lead to incorrect results. The old behavior of simulating a full network extraction can be enabled in the config, but doing so is not recommended for performance reasons, and that option will probably be removed eventually.\r\n* Fix #6307: Make crafting calculations use the cached inventory by default by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6310.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n* Expose IAutoCraftingMenu in API, use player's menu in crafting terminal by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6278\r\n* Refactor CraftingUnitType for easier add-on extensibility by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6277\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and small changes\r\n* Fix #6281: Add void and equal distribution upgrade to fluid cells by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6282\r\n* Add back option to display Facades in REI by @Mari023 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6317\r\n* Add an REI category of P2P tunnel attunement items by @ramidzkh in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6302\r\n* Fix accelerated Export Bus Dupe Issues when Network shows items twice by @shartte in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6296\r\n* Fix #6289: Add powered/unpowered states to ME IO and Spatial IO ports by @62832 in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6290\r\n* Fix #6293: Properly render AppMek patterns by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6308\r\n* Fix #6291: Energy cells' status bars fill when the cell itself is only half-full by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6309\r\n* Fix #6303: increase ME chest power buffer from 40 to 500 by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6324\r\n* Fix #6275: fix wrong requested number in crafting status by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6327\r\n* Fix #6299: add more stuff to common `dusts`/`gems` tags by @Technici4n in https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/pull/6328\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2/compare/forge/v11.0.0...forge/v11.1.0",

This essentially makes certus crystals renewable for the time being.\r\n- Various Color Applicator Enhancements:\r\n  - When held in the off-hand, placed cables will automatically be colored by the color applicator (#3854)\r\n  - While holding a color applicator in the main or off-hand, pointing at a cable/block and clicking the middle-mouse button will select that color in the color applicator (#88)\r\n  - When the color applicator runs out of a particular color, it'll properly reset back to empty to indicate it has run out (#3895)\r\n  - Added a fully kitted out color applicator to the creative menu (all colors, energy upgraded, charged - only works partially on Forge due to Forge bugs)  \r\n- Fix untranslated tooltip of memory cards when used on P2P tunnels (#5998)\r\n- Use higher contrast text color on storage and crafting monitors (#6004)",

This essentially makes certus crystals renewable for the time being.\r\n- Various Color Applicator Enhancements:\r\n  - When held in the off-hand, placed cables will automatically be colored by the color applicator (#3854)\r\n  - While holding a color applicator in the main or off-hand, pointing at a cable/block and clicking the middle-mouse button will select that color in the color applicator (#88)\r\n  - When the color applicator runs out of a particular color, it'll properly reset back to empty to indicate it has run out (#3895)\r\n  - Added a fully kitted out color applicator to the creative menu (all colors, energy upgraded, charged - only works partially on Forge due to Forge bugs)  \r\n- Fix untranslated tooltip of memory cards when used on P2P tunnels (#5998)\r\n- Use higher contrast text color on storage and crafting monitors (#6004)\r\n",

Every insertion will now be taken into account by the next when testing \"does this already contain the ingredients?\". (#5870)\r\n* Fixes that power consumption for Fluid autocrafting was calculated incorrectly and was far too high. Thanks @DrummerMC!

(#5894)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147517845-9485d5a9-fdf2-4f97-8583-14cac6139fca.png)\r\n* Indicate when items are being hidden through JEI or REI search (#5904)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147518211-63b5bc73-3c4f-4895-b4e0-a4eb15e1e1a4.png)\r\n* [Fabric, REI only] Improved REI One-Click Recipe Transfer for encoding processing patterns by adding support for multiple outputs, fluid inputs, and using the exact fluid amount from the recipe automatically. (JEI has no API for this yet) (#5871)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261399/147518472-5d945326-e2f3-4f8f-8aed-2570de8fd445.png)\r\n* Update fluid portable cell textures to match the fluid storage cells (#5887)\r\n* Slightly change crafting recipes for portable cells to ensure players don't accidentally void storage cells by using them to craft portable cells. (#5892)\r\n* Add tooltips to the inscriber slot to describe on which sides they can be automated. (#5881) \r\n* [API] We now publish an API primer and Javadoc on our website: https://appliedenergistics.github.io/api.html\r\n* [Internal] Integrated with Crowdin to enable crowdsourced translations for AE2. Please ask on Discord for details on how to contribute. (#5878)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and other Changes\r\n\r\n* Fixes excessive energy drain for Fluid P2P tunnel. Thanks @DrummerMC! (Fixes #5876)\r\n* Fix Pattern-Provider Blocking Mode when a Crafting CPU with multiple Co-Processors inserted multiple items on the same tick into a storage bus. Every insertion will now be taken into account by the next when testing \"does this already contain the ingredients?\". (#5870)\r\n* Fixes that power consumption for Fluid autocrafting was calculated incorrectly and was far too high. Thanks @DrummerMC! (#5872)\r\n* Fix cables and parts dropping while breaking them in creative mode. They should only drop contained items now. (#5838)\r\n* Fix Tiny TNT destroying waterlogged blocks. Thanks @Azercoco! (#5895)\r\n* Use appropriate 3D models when portable cells are inserted into an ME drive (#5900)\r\n* Fix ME Chest not showing changing cell state (full, empty, etc.) immediately. (#5903)\r\n* Fix client-side ghost parts when security-checks fail for placed parts (#5905)\r\n* Disable rotation feature for network tool allowing it to show the network status on rotatable blocks (#5907)\r\n* Update search in Terminal if the search mode is toggled away from REI/JEI search (#5906)\r\n* Fix sorting for fluids in terminal sorting by millibucket/droplet instead of bucket amount. Thanks @DrummerMC! (#5910)\r\n",

This can be disabled in the client config file under key `showPlacementPreview`.\r\n* Show number of channels and their passive energy drain in the network tool status UI (#5837)\r\n* Added fuzzy card support for the ME Interface, which will stock items based on the configured fuzzy-mode while ignoring NBT data as usual. (#1603)\r\n* Rework how Terminal Search Modes work and introduce better tooltips / new REI/JEI search mode (#5843, #5825). In REI/JEI search mode, the AE search box will now be hidden and the JEI/REI search box will be used instead. Also clarified what \"Auto\" and \"Keep\" mean in the tooltip.\r\n* Reintroduced that on mouse-over only the part attached to a cable will be outlined and not all parts attached to the block.\r\n* Fix inverted block/item placement mode button in formation plane UI\r\n* Fix that the player statistics \"items inserted\" and \"items extracted\" are affected by fluid insertion/extraction (and those count millibuckets/droplets) (#5857)\r\n* Fix \"~ 1\" being shown instead of \"1\" for buckets of fluid in terminals, when the amount was *exactly* 1 bucket.\r\n* Move all network slots 1px to the left to align them with the player inventory slots\r\n* Fix that the crafting plan shows missing items for items that are provided by level-emitters with crafting cards if any other item is missing (#5847)\r\n* Fix ghost-patterns being created when patterns are taken out of pattern providers (#5839)\r\n* Fix middle-mouse button to request crafting for items that are in stock for survival mode (#5852)\r\n* For export buses and interfaces with crafting cards, the system will now auto-craft less than configured if not enough items are available (#96)\r\n* Fix a cable dupe bug where placing a cable onto a pre-placed cable-anchor would dupe the cable if it got immediately broken again due to network security (#5858)\r\n* Fixes that the UI of parts would open when a part was placed on the opposite site of the same cable (#5842)\r\n* [Internal API] Refactored MenuLocator to allow AE2WTlib to more easily allow their terminals to be in trinket slots\r\n",

    "changelog": "**WARNING**\r\n\r\nItems will not migrate over from 1.17 or before due to the mod-id changing to ae2 in this release, and fully unifying fluid/item machines.\r\n\r\nMore in-depth release notes will follow in a later release (probably in the beta).\r\n\r\n## Channel Modes\r\n\r\nThis alpha version introduces new options to change how AE2 channels behave in your world. There's a new configuration option in the general section (channels) which controls this option, and a new in-game comman for operators to change the mode and the config from inside the game. The command is `/ae2 channelmode <mode>` to change it and `/ae2 channelmode` to show the current mode. When the mode is changed in-game, all existing grids will reboot and use the new mode immediately.\r\n\r\nAvailable modes:\r\n\r\n- `default` The standard mode with the known channel capacities of cable and ad-hoc networks\r\n- `x2` All channel capacities are doubled (16 on normal cable, 64 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 16 channels)\r\n- `x3` All channel capacities are tripled (24 on normal cable, 92 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 24 channels)\r\n- `x4` All channel capacities are quadrupled (32 on normal cable, 128 on dense cable, ad-hoc networks support 32 channels)\r\n- `infinite` All channel restrictions are removed. Controllers still reduce the power consumption of grids *significantly*. Smart cables will only toggle between completely off (no channels carried) and completely on (1 or more channels carried).\r\n\r\nThis resurrects and improves upon the option that was available before 1.15 and introduces better options for players that just want a little more laid back gameplay but don't want the mechanic to be removed entirely.\r\n\r\nSince this option is brand new, we'd appreciate intense testing of it. Please report and issues you might find on our GitHub / Discord.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- [Forge] Fix recipe for copying silicon plates (#5796)\r\n- Fix pattern provider not displaying where it is pointing if it is made directional with a wrench\r\n- Fix disassembly of fluid cells returning an item instead of a fluid cell housing (#5808, thanks ramidzkh!)\r\n- Fixes various ticking issues with AE2 machines, primarily machines waking up potentially preventing other machines from ticking for some time. (Use a debug card in your off-hand to see the ticking behavior of AE2 machines in WTHIT/Jade)\r\n- Fix Import-/Export-Bus Redstone Pulse Behavior. Upon receiving a redstone pulse, the bus will now wake itself up and perform the operation on the next tick. It now correctly remembers that a pulse occured even if it doesn't get a chance to tick before the chunk/world is unloaded. Fixes that buses would mis-interpret a high redstone signal at world load as a pulse\r\n- Fixes the charger always using its minimum tick rate and ignoring the maximum\r\n- Fixes crafting simulation if multiple options to craft the same item exist\r\n- Fixes the matter cannon crashing if it had no ammo when fired (#5806)\r\n- Fixes the matter cannon crashing if fired from a dispenser (#5814)\r\n- Fixes storage and conversion monitors not showing the stored amount and not abbreviating large amounts (#5819)\r\n- Fixes interfaces not moving out items from their storage into the network while waiting for items to craft while using a crafting card upgrade, essentially preventing the crafted items from being inserted (#5803)\r\n- Fixes tooltips saying \"JEI\" instead of \"REI\" on Fabric, and renamed \"FE P2P Tunnel\" to \"Energy P2P Tunnel\" (#5677)\r\n- Fixes cables attempting to connect through cable anchors/parts to adjacent blocks if the cable anchor/part was placed before the cable (prevent needless network reboot) (#5820)\r\n- Fixes AE2 blocks retaining their configuration when being broken/disassembled, making them unstackable. A memory card must be used instead to copy the config if needed (#5818)\r\n- Fixes a rare problem where opening an AE2 screen would leave a zombie screen open if the block was already removed on the client before the screen actually got a chance to open. This fixes a crash when certain other mods were used (seamless_loading_screen). AE2 will now log a message sooner and close the screen server-side. (#5642)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Introduced more information to WTHIT/Jade when looking at smart cables. For Ad-Hoc Networks, two error states will be shown (Too Many Channels, Nested P2P Tunnel) to explain why an Ad-Hoc network has gone offline. For networks with controllers, it now shows if there are two conflicting controllers on the grid.\r\n- Minimum boot times of networks have been reduced from 20 to 5 ticks. The increase in boot time for additional nodes is still the same.\r\n- During a network boot, 4 steps are now taken per tick instead of 1. This is configurable now in a new config option `pathfindingStepsPerTick` in case you experience severe server-side tick latency when networks reboot\r\n- \"Partial Plan (Missing Ingredients)\" is now shown instead of \"Simulation\" when auto-crafting cannot be started due to missing items\r\n- Use correct tag for wrenches so wrenches from other mods should now be usable\r\n- Remove spam about data fixers not being registered for AE2 entities (they still aren't, but no more log spam)\r\n- Use the default locale to format storage amounts (mostly affects the decimal point)\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n- [Breaking, API]: Removed InteractionHand from `IPart#onPlacement` and `IPartHost#addPart`\r\n- [API] TickingRequest now allows the initial tick rate to be specified separately (default is still (min+max)/2)\r\n- [Breaking, API]: Removed the directionality of `IPartHost#hasRedstone` since it wasn't directional internally and just returns if the block the cable is in is receiving a redstone signal.\r\n- [Breaking, API]: Some changes to `IAEStackRenderHandler`, `AEKeyType` (for custom addon storage types) related to formatting amounts. Formatting is now automatically provided based on the amount per unit (i.e. 1000 for Fluids) and the unit symbol (i.e. 'B' for fluids).\r\n- [Internal] Allow SlotSemantic to be used by addons that target AE2's internal classes\r\n- [API] Add `#getMaxChannels` and `#getUsedChannels` to IGridNode\r\n- [API] Add `#getChannelMode` to `IPathingService` to retrieve the current channel mode used for a grid\r\n- [API] `PartHelper` now has a `getPart` method to more easily get the part attached at a certain position in the world\r\n- [Breaking, API] Various changes around `IPart` now being based only around an `IPartItem` instance, no longer around `ItemStack`",
