AE2 itself adds</div><a href="/features/world-gen/certus-quartz-crystal">Certus Quartz Crystal</a>, and makes use of vanilla&#x27;s <span>Nether Quartz</span> as well. The first tier of AE2 tech, such as the <a href="/features/simple-tools/certus-quartz-tools/certus-quartz-wrench">Certus Quartz Wrench</a>, <a href="/features/simple-tools/certus-quartz-tools/certus-quartz-cutting-knife">Certus Quartz Cutting Knife</a>, and Certus Quartz tools, uses Certus Quartz as the primary crafting ingredient. The<a href="/features/world-gen/certus-quartz-crystal">Certus Quartz Crystal</a> can also be ground up in the Grindstone to produce <a href="/features/certus-quartz-dust">Certus Quartz Dust</a> (as can Nether Quartz), which is then used in Certus Glass (ingredient in most Tech 2 items), Tiny TNT (used in the creation of Singularities, a very advanced item in AE2), and most importantly to make Seeds.<h3>Growing Crystals</h3><div class="block">Everything about AE2 is meant to be automated. Everything, right down to the
aquisition of the most basic ingredients added by the mod. Seeds are one of
the most important parts of the &quot;early game&quot; of AE2. By combining <a href="/features/certus-quartz-dust">Certus Quartz Dust</a> or <a href="/features/nether-quartz-dust">Nether Quartz Dust</a> (produced in the
Grindstone or similar process in another mod) with Sand, you can create items
called Seeds.</div><div><div class="title is-4">Crystal Seeds</div></div><div class="ItemGrid_itemGrid__3OPEn"><a href="/features/growing-crystals/certus-quartz-seed"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/certus_crystal_seed.png" alt="Certus Quartz Seed" title="Certus Quartz Seed" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/growing-crystals/fluix-seed"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/fluix_crystal_seed.png" alt="Fluix Seed" title="Fluix Seed" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/growing-crystals/nether-quartz-seed"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/nether_quartz_seed.png" alt="Nether Quartz Seed" title="Nether Quartz Seed" class="item-icon"/></a></div>These Seeds, when placed in water, will grow into their respective crystal types. If you&#x27;ve looked carefully, you&#x27;ll see that you get 2 seeds per 1 dust, this allows you to double your crystals for most uses in AE2. This growth is accelerated by (unsurprisingly) <a href="/features/me-network/powered-machines/crystal-growth-accelerator">Crystal Growth Accelerator</a>.<h3>Alright, I have a bunch of Nether and Certus Quartz; how do I move up in the world?</h3><div class="block">After some investigation, you&#x27;ve probably noticed that to move up through the
tech tree you need <a href="/features/growing-crystals/fluix-crystal">Fluix Crystal</a>. <a href="/features/growing-crystals/fluix-crystal">Fluix Crystal</a> are made through two
processes:</div><ol><li>Tossing some Fluix Seeds into water and waiting.</li><li>Throwing Charged Certus, <span>Nether Quartz</span>, and <span>Redstone Dust</span> into a pool of water and waiting.</li></ol><div class="block">Alright, sounds simple enough. Just toss some of that Certus and Nether Quartz
in some water with some of the Redstone you&#x27;ve undoubtedtly collected, and
voila!</div><div class="block">Nope, not gonna work. If you noticed the word &quot;Charged&quot; in front of &quot;Certus&quot;
above, that&#x27;s the reason. Fluix requires <em><a href="/features/world-gen/charged-certus-quartz-crystal">Charged Certus Quartz Crystal</a></em>, not
normal<a href="/features/world-gen/certus-quartz-crystal">Certus Quartz Crystal</a>.
You can create <a href="/features/world-gen/charged-certus-quartz-crystal">Charged Certus Quartz Crystal</a> in a
Charger, which can be powered by a Vibration Chamber full of coal. But, hang
on again; all that stuff requires Fluix, and we have none of that, and
precious little of the Charged Certus (if you haven&#x27;t noticed by now, some
Charged Certus is available in the worldgen along with normal Certus). You&#x27;ll
also notice you can&#x27;t create dust or seeds from the Charged Certus. Sucks,
right? Only a little; since you need primarily uncharged <a href="/features/world-gen/certus-quartz-crystal">Certus Quartz Crystal</a>, <span>Nether Quartz</span>, and <a href="/features/growing-crystals/fluix-crystal">Fluix Crystal</a> in the first stages of the
mod, you can get away with making most of the Charged Certus into Fluix right
away. Then, be sure to make some Fluix Seeds. After working so hard to find
all that Charged Certus, you don&#x27;t want to run out too soon!</div><div class="block">It&#x27;s going to take a while to grow the Fluix without any Accelerators handy.
Don&#x27;t worry, though; it&#x27;s worth the wait. After growing some Fluix, make a</div><a href="/features/me-network/network-power/vibration-chamber">Vibration Chamber</a> and a<a href="/features/me-network/powered-machines/charger">Charger</a>, and some <a href="/features/me-network/powered-machines/crystal-growth-accelerator">Crystal Growth Accelerator</a>, all the while being sure to keep your quartz and Fluix supply up using seeds and mining. After this, you&#x27;re set to start on the next level of tech with an <a href="/features/me-network/powered-machines/inscriber">Inscriber</a>.<h2>Unlocking Technology - Hunting For The Last Few Pieces</h2><h3>I can&#x27;t make any of the circuits like in AE1, and the plates for the Inscriber don&#x27;t have a crafting recipe. Is AE2 broken?</h3><div class="block">No, AE2 isn&#x27;t broken. The &quot;final&quot; pieces of the AE2 puzzle needed to move up
the tech tree into ME Networks are the Inscriber Presses. There are four
presses that you need (Listed in order of &quot;tier&quot;):</div><div><div class="title is-4">Processor Press Plates</div></div><div class="ItemGrid_itemGrid__3OPEn"><a href="/features/processors/calculation-processor"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/calculation_processor.png" alt="Calculation Processor" title="Calculation Processor" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/processors/engineering-processor"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/engineering_processor.png" alt="Engineering Processor" title="Engineering Processor" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/presses/inscriber-calculation-press"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/calculation_processor_press.png" alt="Inscriber Calculation Press" title="Inscriber Calculation Press" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/presses/inscriber-engineering-press"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/engineering_processor_press.png" alt="Inscriber Engineering Press" title="Inscriber Engineering Press" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/presses/inscriber-logic-press"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/logic_processor_press.png" alt="Inscriber Logic Press" title="Inscriber Logic Press" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/presses/inscriber-silicon-press"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/silicon_press.png" alt="Inscriber Silicon Press" title="Inscriber Silicon Press" class="item-icon"/></a><a href="/features/processors/logic-processor"><img src="/icons/appliedenergistics2/logic_processor.png" alt="Logic Processor" title="Logic Processor" class="item-icon"/></a></div>These presses are used to make the Circuits needed for the Tech 2 machines and beyond. They&#x27;re found randomly in <a href="/features/simple-tools/skystone-chests/sky-stone-chest">Sky Stone Chest</a>, which are located within Meteorites. Meteorites are randomly spawned throughout the world, normally underground. So, the hunt begins!<div class="block">This hunt is a little less aimless than the hunt for your first <a href="/features/world-gen/charged-certus-quartz-crystal">Charged Certus Quartz Crystal</a>. You&#x27;ll
have a tool to help you on your way, the <a href="/features/world-gen/meteorite-compass">Meteorite Compass</a>. The Compass will point you
toward the chunk the meteor has generated in, not the specific block or the
center of the meteor itself. You&#x27;ll have to do some digging and searching in
order to find the meteor, and then you&#x27;ll have to take it apart and find the
center, which is where the <a href="/features/simple-tools/skystone-chests/sky-stone-chest">Sky Stone Chest</a> will be located.</div><h3>I did it!</h3><div class="block">After this is where the fun starts. You now have all the tools to start making
the complex pieces that Applied Energistics has to offer! Get out there and
start filling up data drives.</div><h1>Matter Energy Tech: ME Networks and Storage</h1><h3>What is ME Storage?</h3><div class="block">Its pronounced Emm-Eee, and stands for Matter Energy.</div><div class="block">Matter Energy is the main component of Applied Energistics 2, it&#x27;s like a mad
scientist version of a Multi-Block chest, and it can revolutionize your
storage situation. ME is extremely different then other storage systems in
Minecraft, and it might take a little out of the box thinking to get used to;
but once you get started vast amounts of storage in tiny space, and multiple
access terminals are just the tip of the iceberg of what becomes possible.</div><h3>What do I need to know to get started?</h3><div class="block">First, ME Stores items inside of other items, called Storage Cells; there are
4 tiers with ever increasing amounts of storage. In order to use a Storage
Cell it must be placed inside either an <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a>, or an <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-drive">ME Drive</a>.</div><div><div class="title is-4">Storage Cells</div></div><div class="ItemGrid_itemGrid__3OPEn"></div>The <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a> shows you the contents of the Cell as soon as its placed inside, and you can add and remove items from it as if it were a <span>Chest</span>, with the exception that the items are actually stored in the Storage cells, and not the <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a> itself.<div class="block">While the <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a> is a great way
to get introduced to the concept of ME, to really take advantage you need to
set up an <a href="/features/me-network">ME Network</a>.</div><h3>How do I setup my first network?</h3><div class="block">An <a href="/features/me-network">ME Network</a> is pretty easy to get started you
need 2 things, an <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a> / or</div><a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-drive">ME Drive</a>, and an <a href="/features/me-network/network-hid/me-terminal">ME Terminal</a> ( or <a href="/features/me-network/network-hid/me-crafting-terminal">ME Crafting Terminal</a> ) you&#x27;ll also need some kind of cable, such as <a href="/features/me-network/network-connections/me-glass-cable">Fluix ME Glass Cable</a> to attach the <a href="/features/me-network/network-hid/me-terminal">ME Terminal</a> too.<div class="block">Place all these next to each other, and you have the world&#x27;s simplest network,
storage and access.</div><div class="block">You can add storage cells to the <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-drive">ME Drive</a>, or use one in a <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-chest">ME Chest</a> for storage, and access it all from
the <a href="/features/me-network/network-hid/me-terminal">ME Terminal</a>.</div><div class="block">You might want to add more <a href="/features/me-network/network-hid/me-terminal">ME Terminal</a> to other rooms, for this you&#x27;ll
want to make some <a href="/features/me-network/network-connections/me-glass-cable">Fluix ME Glass Cable</a>, any ME Blocks attached
to <a href="/features/me-network/network-connections/me-glass-cable">Fluix ME Glass Cable</a> will be
connected to the <a href="/features/me-network">ME Network</a></div><h3>Expanding your Network</h3><div class="block">So you have some basic storage, and access to that storage, its a good start,
but you&#x27;ll likely be looking to maybe automate some processing.</div><div class="block">A great example of this is to place a <a href="/features/me-network/network-functions/me-export-bus">ME Item Export Bus</a> on the top of a furnace to
dump in ores, and a <a href="/features/me-network/network-functions/me-import-bus">ME Item Import Bus</a>
on the bottom of the furance to extract furnaced ores.</div><div class="block">The <a href="/features/me-network/network-functions/me-export-bus">ME Item Export Bus</a> lets you export
items from the network, into the attached inventory, while the <a href="/features/me-network/network-functions/me-import-bus">ME Item Import Bus</a> imports items from the
attached inventory into the network.</div><h3>Overcoming Limits</h3><div class="block">At this point you probably getting close to 8 or so devices, once you hit 9
devices you&#x27;ll have to start managing <a href="/features/channels">channels</a>. Many
devices but not all, require a <a href="/features/channels">channel</a> to function.
If the device deals solely with power, or connectivity like cables the device
will not require a <a href="/features/channels">channel</a>. Anything that uses
items, or moves them around, will.</div><div class="block">By default network can support 8 <a href="/features/channels">channels</a>, once you
break this limit, you&#x27;ll have to add an <a href="/features/me-controller">ME Controller</a> to your network. this allows
you to expand your network greatly.</div><div class="block">Each face of the controller will output 32 <a href="/features/channels">channels</a>,
depending on whats is accepting these <a href="/features/channels">channels</a> will
determin how they get used, for instance, if you place a <a href="/features/me-network/network-connections/me-dense-cable">Fluix ME Dense Covered Cable</a> next tohe
controller you will beable to carry a full 32
<a href="/features/channels">channels</a>, however if you place a <a href="/features/me-network/network-storage/me-drive">ME Drive</a> next to it, or non-dense cable, you
will only get 8 <a href="/features/channels">channels</a>.</div><h3>Tunneling</h3><div class="block">So your getting things started, but getting <a href="/features/channels">channels</a>
where you want them is kinda a nusance. Its time to start using <a href="/features/me-network/misc/p2p-tunnel">ME P2P Tunnel</a>. These when configured for
ME, allow you to move <a href="/features/channels">channels</a> from point to point;
this allows you to move up to 32 <a href="/features/channels">channels</a> per pair
of <a href="/features/me-network/misc/p2p-tunnel">ME P2P Tunnel</a>.</div><div class="block"><div style="display:inline-block;max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;max-width:100%"><img style="max-width:100%;display:block;margin:0;border:none;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTgyNSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI5MTYiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4xIi8+"/></div><img alt="A example of using P2P Tunnels to move channels." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="A example of using P2P Tunnels to move channels." src="/assets/large/tunnelchannels.png" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></div></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"var h=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,o=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var d=(e,i,a)=\u003ei in e?h(e,i,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:a}):e[i]=a,t=(e,i)=\u003e{for(var a in i||(i={}))r.call(i,a)\u0026\u0026d(e,a,i[a]);if(s)for(var a of s(i))o.call(i,a)\u0026\u0026d(e,a,i[a]);return e},l=(e,i)=\u003ec(e,m(i));var p=(e,i)=\u003e{var a={};for(var n in e)r.call(e,n)\u0026\u0026i.indexOf(n)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(a[n]=e[n]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026s)for(var n of s(e))i.indexOf(n)\u003c0\u0026\u0026o.call(e,n)\u0026\u0026(a[n]=e[n]);return a};const makeShortcode=e=\u003efunction(a){return console.warn(\"Component \"+e+\" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope\"),mdx(\"div\",t({},a))},ItemLink=makeShortcode(\"ItemLink\"),CategoryIndex=makeShortcode(\"CategoryIndex\"),layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(a){var n=a,{components:e}=n,i=p(n,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,l(t(t({},layoutProps),i),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"h1\",null,\"Getting Started with Applied Energistics 2\"),mdx(\"h3\",null,\"My Very First Quartz\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The first step to getting started in AE2 is to acquire Quartz.
