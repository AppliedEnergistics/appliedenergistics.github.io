I've been the only person working on the art,\ncode, and dealing with most support issues since the project's inception. I\nrealize now that my mistake was never accepting help until it was too late.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Over the past 2 weeks, I've attempted to try and rectify my mistake, however\nits become painfully clear I was far too late in making this change and things\nhave only snowballed drastically, instead of improving. After debating what to\ndo and considering various options, I have come to a decision.`}</p>\n    <p>{`With a heavy heart I resign as developer of AE2. I will, over the next several\nweeks, be working with several people to open up the mod and put a team\ntogether to carry on at minimum maintaining the mod as I step down.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Thanks for everyone's support and encouragement these past two years, and\nhopefully this transition will be as smooth as possible.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Sep 23 2014 - AlgorithmX2`}</h3>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
