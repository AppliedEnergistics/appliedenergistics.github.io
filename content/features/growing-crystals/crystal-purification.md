# Crystal Purification

Some devices in Applied Energistics 2 require pure crystals instead of the raw
crystals you find in the endowment, and while not necessary most recipes that
take raw crystals will also take pure crystals, the advantage is that you can
get two pure crystals for any 1 raw crystals allowing you to get more crystals
for your efforts.

Purifying Crystals is a fairly simple process, first you must make a seed,
this is done by crafting <ItemLink id="minecraft:sand"/> and any
crystal dust; then simply drop/throw the seed in water, this process will be
extremely slow ( several hours ) without a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:quartz_growth_accelerator"/> but it is
possible, by using the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:quartz_growth_accelerator"/> you can cut the
purification down to minutes, or less if you use more.
