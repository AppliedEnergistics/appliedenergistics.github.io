![A picture of 3 terminals.](../../../../public/assets/large/terminal.png)The <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:terminal"/> is a HID which gives you access
to a [ME Network](../../me-network.md)'s Networked Storage.

It has the ability to sort and search, as well as filter by using <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:view_cell"/>. It requires a
[channel](../../channels.md) to function.

Can be upgraded into a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:crafting_terminal"/>.
