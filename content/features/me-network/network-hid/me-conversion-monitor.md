title: ME Conversion Monitor
---

The <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_conversion_monitor"/> is the
upgraded version of the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:storage_monitor"/>. It adds the ability to
directly withdraw from or store items into the [ME Network](../ME-
Network/index.html). The <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:item_conversion_monitor"/> can be locked (or
unlocked) by right-clicking it with a wrench or network tool. When unlocked,
it will display any item it's right-clicked with. Shift-right-clicking
attempts to insert the item into the network. Shift-double-right-clicking
attempts to insert all items of the type displayed into the network. If the
monitor is locked, right-clicking attempts to pull out a stack of the item
displayed. You cannot insert wrenches or network tools, because shift-right-
click will collect the monitor.
