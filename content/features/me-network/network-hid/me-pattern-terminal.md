title: ME Pattern Terminal
---

A specialized version of the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:crafting_terminal"/> designed to encode <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:blank_pattern"/> into <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:crafting_pattern"/> or <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:processing_pattern"/>.

Lets you browse the contents of your network like other terminals, but also
contains an area for designing patterns. There are two modes for pattern
encoding. Crafting Patterns, and Processing Patterns. Processing patterns are
designed for use with machines that do not use standard crafting recipes; such
as furnaces, or other machines. To select between modes, click the button to
the right of the interface; when it shows a standard crafting table, it will
create Crafting Patterns, and when it shows a furnace, it will create
Processing Patterns.

For Crafting Patterns ("Crafts..."), you specify the input crafting materials
on a standard 3x3 crafting grid, and the output materials are determined
automatically.

For Processing Patterns ("Creates..."), you specify the input materials and
output materials, including quantity, by placing stacks of items in the
interface. If a processing operation is not guaranteed to succeed (such as
secondary products from some machines), it will not work correctly as a
Processing Pattern.

When designing crafting patterns you can click the output to extract a crafted
item as long as you have the materials required to craft the item.
