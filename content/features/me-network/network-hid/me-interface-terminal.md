Gives remote access to all interface pattern slots on your network separated
by which type of machine they are on. It will show the type of machine in the
terminal, however you can name the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:item_interface"/> in the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:inscriber"/> or an Anvil to alter the name
displayed in the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:interface_terminal"/>.

Combined with the fact that you can toggle if the interface shows up at all
this gets you control over your itnerface terminal's display.
