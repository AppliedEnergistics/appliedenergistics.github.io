title: Quantum Entangled Singularity
---

Required to create a connection between to [Quantum Network Bridges](../ME-
Quantum-Network-Bridge/index.html), they are always produced in matching
pairs, to create a connection place 1 of the pair of <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:quantum_entangled_singularity"/> into the
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:quantum_link"/> of
the bridge on each side.

### Crafting Quantum Entangled Singularities



Item crafted by causing a reaction between <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:ender_dust"/> and <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:singularity"/>. Any Explosive force should
be enough to trigger the reaction. Note that the ender pearl dust from portal
gun is not in the ore dictinoary, and will not work



 ** _*Nearly any explosion will work, the demo below uses TNT, but even
creepers will work._**



Always produced in pairs, but only requiring a single <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:singularity"/>.



It might be a good idea to label these with names when you create them using
the vanilla anvil.



### Example





### Note for Anti Griefing Servers



AE also includes a block called <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:tiny_tnt"/>, this is a small craftable TNT
which can have its block damage disabled, but can still hurt a litttle, and
can be used as an alternative to vanilla tnt / other explosions even when
block damage is disabled.
