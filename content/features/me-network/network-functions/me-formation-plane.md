title: ME Formation Plane
---

The <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_formation_plane"/> is a part
designed to place or drop any item put into the [ME Network](../../me-network.md).
It functions as storage similar to how a <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_storage_bus"/>, so items
that are added to the network are dropped or placed passively. You can configure
the <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_formation_plane"/> to indicate specific
items it should place. Items are placed instantly when they enter the network.

Requires a [channel](../channels.md) to function.
