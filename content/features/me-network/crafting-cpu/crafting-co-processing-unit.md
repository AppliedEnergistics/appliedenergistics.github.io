![A picture of several Co Processors in a Crafting
CPU.](../../../../public/assets/large/craftingco.png)Component of the [Crafting
CPU](../../crafting-cpu.md) which provides additional item delivery from
the CPU to the <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_interface"/> for
crafting.



This can be used to make more assemblers active in parallel for the job, and
thus increase overall crafting speed. These only help if your setup has steps
properly separated so the system can run multiple tasks in parallel, or even
split the same pattern across multiple interfaces.
