![A picture of some stone brick facades.](../../public/assets/large/facade.png)Facades
are crafted with any facadeable block in the middle of the crafting table, and
4 cable anchors around it. They can be mounted on any varient of cables, and
around buses. They can be used to create a solid surface for things like
levers or buttons, but are for the most part decrative in nature.
