Encoded version of <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:blank_pattern"/> created by using the
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:pattern_terminal"/>.



Can contain two diffrent types of data crafting recipes, or processing recipes



### Crafting Recipes



Crafting Recipes are very specific, and automatically have an output
associated with them, these are required to work with a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:molecular_assembler"/>.



The description of a crafting pattern starts with "Crafts".



### Processing Recipes



Processing recipes are not crafting recipes, they have no rules to their
inputs, or outputs, and are used for things like machines or furances, they
can support up to 9 different inputs, and up to 3 diffrent outputs ( these
outputs cannot be random chance, each output must still be a 100% chance. )



The description of a processing pattern starts with "Creates".
