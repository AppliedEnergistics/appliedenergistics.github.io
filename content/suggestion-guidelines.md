# Suggestion Guidelines

Please review the following list and see if your suggestion is valid prior to
posting.

### 1. Is your suggestion already possible using Vanilla + AE2?

If it is, your suggestion is not valid, one of the core principles for AE2 is
that I don't add duplicate content, these types of addition slowly simplify
the mod into a box of solutions that require no thought or creativity to use.
AE2 strives to be a toolbox of modules that can be used to create solutions
instead. I think this is more fun.

### 2. Are you asking to add any of the following features?

  * Annihilation Plane Filter
  * Change Meteorite Compass Behavior
  * Show the custom name of the machine in the pattern terminal ( [you need to name the interface, not the machine](features/me-network/network-hid/me-interface-terminal.md) )

### 3. Are you asking for a smaller version, more compact version, or more
efficient version of something in the mod?

Rule #1 should already have stopped you, but in case you for some reason
think your suggestion didn't apply to that rule, but it does to this one,
compactness is not a priority of AE2, some of its features tend to be small,
but its focus is on modular game-play, not creating single block solutions.
Also Rule #1 did apply.
