# Getting Started with Applied Energistics 2



### My Very First Quartz

The first step to getting started in AE2 is to acquire Quartz. AE2 itself adds
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_crystal"/>, and
makes use of vanilla's <ItemLink id="minecraft:quartz"/> as
well. The first tier of AE2 tech, such as the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_wrench"/>, <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_cutting_knife"/>, and Certus
Quartz tools, uses Certus Quartz as the primary crafting ingredient. The
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_crystal"/> can also
be ground up in the Grindstone to produce <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_dust"/> (as can Nether
Quartz), which is then used in Certus Glass (ingredient in most Tech 2 items),
Tiny TNT (used in the creation of Singularities, a very advanced item in AE2),
and most importantly to make Seeds.



### Growing Crystals

Everything about AE2 is meant to be automated. Everything, right down to the
aquisition of the most basic ingredients added by the mod. Seeds are one of
the most important parts of the "early game" of AE2. By combining <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_dust"/> or <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:nether_quartz_dust"/> (produced in the
Grindstone or similar process in another mod) with Sand, you can create items
called Seeds.

<CategoryIndex category="Crystal Seeds" />
  
These Seeds, when placed in water, will grow into their respective crystal
types. If you've looked carefully, you'll see that you get 2 seeds per 1 dust,
this allows you to double your crystals for most uses in AE2. This growth is
accelerated by (unsurprisingly) <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:quartz_growth_accelerator"/>.

### Alright, I have a bunch of Nether and Certus Quartz; how do I move up in
the world?



After some investigation, you've probably noticed that to move up through the
tech tree you need <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_crystal"/>. <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_crystal"/> are made through two
processes:



  1. Tossing some Fluix Seeds into water and waiting.
  2. Throwing Charged Certus, <ItemLink id="minecraft:quartz"/>, and <ItemLink id="minecraft:redstone"/> into a pool of water and waiting.



Alright, sounds simple enough. Just toss some of that Certus and Nether Quartz
in some water with some of the Redstone you've undoubtedtly collected, and
voila!



Nope, not gonna work. If you noticed the word "Charged" in front of "Certus"
above, that's the reason. Fluix requires _<ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:charged_certus_quartz_crystal"/>_, not
normal<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_crystal"/>.
You can create <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:charged_certus_quartz_crystal"/> in a
Charger, which can be powered by a Vibration Chamber full of coal. But, hang
on again; all that stuff requires Fluix, and we have none of that, and
precious little of the Charged Certus (if you haven't noticed by now, some
Charged Certus is available in the worldgen along with normal Certus). You'll
also notice you can't create dust or seeds from the Charged Certus. Sucks,
right? Only a little; since you need primarily uncharged <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:certus_quartz_crystal"/>, <ItemLink
id="minecraft:quartz"/>, and <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_crystal"/> in the first stages of the
mod, you can get away with making most of the Charged Certus into Fluix right
away. Then, be sure to make some Fluix Seeds. After working so hard to find
all that Charged Certus, you don't want to run out too soon!



It's going to take a while to grow the Fluix without any Accelerators handy.
Don't worry, though; it's worth the wait. After growing some Fluix, make a
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:vibration_chamber"/> and a
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:charger"/>, and some <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:quartz_growth_accelerator"/>, all the while
being sure to keep your quartz and Fluix supply up using seeds and mining.
After this, you're set to start on the next level of tech with an <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:inscriber"/>.



## Unlocking Technology - Hunting For The Last Few Pieces



### I can't make any of the circuits like in AE1, and the plates for the
Inscriber don't have a crafting recipe. Is AE2 broken?



No, AE2 isn't broken. The "final" pieces of the AE2 puzzle needed to move up
the tech tree into ME Networks are the Inscriber Presses. There are four
presses that you need (Listed in order of "tier"):

<CategoryIndex category="Processor Press Plates" />
  
These presses are used to make the Circuits needed for the Tech 2 machines and
beyond. They're found randomly in <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:sky_stone_chest"/>, which are located within
Meteorites. Meteorites are randomly spawned throughout the world, normally
underground. So, the hunt begins!



This hunt is a little less aimless than the hunt for your first <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:charged_certus_quartz_crystal"/>. You'll
have a tool to help you on your way, the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:sky_compass"/>. The Compass will point you
toward the chunk the meteor has generated in, not the specific block or the
center of the meteor itself. You'll have to do some digging and searching in
order to find the meteor, and then you'll have to take it apart and find the
center, which is where the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:sky_stone_chest"/> will be located.



### I did it!



After this is where the fun starts. You now have all the tools to start making
the complex pieces that Applied Energistics has to offer! Get out there and
start filling up data drives.



# Matter Energy Tech: ME Networks and Storage



### What is ME Storage?



Its pronounced Emm-Eee, and stands for Matter Energy.



Matter Energy is the main component of Applied Energistics 2, it's like a mad
scientist version of a Multi-Block chest, and it can revolutionize your
storage situation. ME is extremely different then other storage systems in
Minecraft, and it might take a little out of the box thinking to get used to;
but once you get started vast amounts of storage in tiny space, and multiple
access terminals are just the tip of the iceberg of what becomes possible.



### What do I need to know to get started?



First, ME Stores items inside of other items, called Storage Cells; there are
4 tiers with ever increasing amounts of storage. In order to use a Storage
Cell it must be placed inside either an <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/>, or an <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:drive"/>.

<CategoryIndex category="Storage Cells" />
  
The <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/> shows you the
contents of the Cell as soon as its placed inside, and you can add and remove
items from it as if it were a <ItemLink id="minecraft:chest"/>, with
the exception that the items are actually stored in the Storage cells, and not
the <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/> itself.



While the <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/> is a great way
to get introduced to the concept of ME, to really take advantage you need to
set up an [ME Network](features/me-network.md).



### How do I setup my first network?



An [ME Network](features/me-network.md) is pretty easy to get started you
need 2 things, an <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/> / or
<ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:drive"/>, and an <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:terminal"/> ( or <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:crafting_terminal"/> ) you'll also need some
kind of cable, such as <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_glass_cable"/> to attach the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:terminal"/> too.



Place all these next to each other, and you have the world's simplest network,
storage and access.



You can add storage cells to the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:drive"/>, or use one in a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:chest"/> for storage, and access it all from
the <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:terminal"/>.



You might want to add more <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:terminal"/> to other rooms, for this you'll
want to make some <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_glass_cable"/>, any ME Blocks attached
to <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_glass_cable"/> will be
connected to the [ME Network](features/me-network.md)



### Expanding your Network



So you have some basic storage, and access to that storage, its a good start,
but you'll likely be looking to maybe automate some processing.



A great example of this is to place a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:item_export_bus"/> on the top of a furnace to
dump in ores, and a <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_import_bus"/>
on the bottom of the furance to extract furnaced ores.



The <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:item_export_bus"/> lets you export
items from the network, into the attached inventory, while the <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:item_import_bus"/> imports items from the
attached inventory into the network.



### Overcoming Limits



At this point you probably getting close to 8 or so devices, once you hit 9
devices you'll have to start managing [channels](features/channels.md). Many
devices but not all, require a [channel](features/channels.md) to function.
If the device deals solely with power, or connectivity like cables the device
will not require a [channel](features/channels.md). Anything that uses
items, or moves them around, will.



By default network can support 8 [channels](features/channels.md), once you
break this limit, you'll have to add an <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:controller"/> to your network. this allows
you to expand your network greatly.



Each face of the controller will output 32 [channels](features/channels.md),
depending on whats is accepting these [channels](features/channels.md) will
determin how they get used, for instance, if you place a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:fluix_covered_dense_cable"/> next tohe
controller you will beable to carry a full 32
[channels](features/channels.md), however if you place a <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:drive"/> next to it, or non-dense cable, you
will only get 8 [channels](features/channels.md).

### Tunneling

So your getting things started, but getting [channels](features/channels.md)
where you want them is kinda a nusance. Its time to start using <ItemLink
id="appliedenergistics2:me_p2p_tunnel"/>. These when configured for
ME, allow you to move [channels](features/channels.md) from point to point;
this allows you to move up to 32 [channels](features/channels.md) per pair
of <ItemLink id="appliedenergistics2:me_p2p_tunnel"/>.

channels.](../public/assets/large/tunnelchannels.png)
